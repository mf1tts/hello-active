# The Cleanest Thing
This is a really simple starting point for the [active](https://github.com/IgorKirei/active) framework for nodejs.  It demos basic routing, and the only really 'interesting' thing I've done is drop the settings in config.json outside the code.  

Right now it's going to want to run on [http://localhost:719](http://localhost:719).
